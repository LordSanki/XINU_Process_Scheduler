DEFAULT Xinu Scheduling Policy
------------------------------

Advantage: Light weight scheduler. Less overhead. No extra storage for 
quanta.

Disadvantage: Processes with low prioority can starve as higher process 
will keep getting rescheduled.

=================

LINUXSCHED Policy
-----------------

Advantage: Avoids starvation as each process will get a quantum to run in 
each epoch.

Disadvantage: Overhead of computing quantums at each epoch.
No way to ensure smooth runtime for Real Time processes.

=================


MULTIQSCHED Policy
------------------

Advantage: Processes can be split into multiple queues according to their
response time requirement. Realtime processes can be scheduled more often than
normal processes to make their response time less while still ensuring that
all process will eventually get executed and not starve.

Disadvantage: Overhead of mentaining multiple queues. Scheduling based on
random number hence a fairness of random function will affect scheduling.
Realtime process might get delayed response as the random function may not
select them often enough. Simillarly very high priority processes in normal
queue might not get enough runtime if we have a large RealTime Queue.
